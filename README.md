# Lissajous Curves

Inspired by the Dadaist artist Max Ernst who painted [Lissajous figures][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve] by swinging a punctured bucked of paint over a canvas, I similarly used different mathematical parameters for auto-generation of Lissajous curves. 


Varying degrees of delta produces different x and y components, generating unique curves, and varying values of theta, gave different stages of progression in the formation of the final product. Here is an example for the evolvement of few lissajous curves:
